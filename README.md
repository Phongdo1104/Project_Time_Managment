<h1>About</h1>
<p>This project is Time Management App (as you can see the title of repository), which was made back in April 2020 for a certain subject in my Second-year University Student as a review before my Final Semester project (which is Project Manaement App).</p>
<p>This project is not perfect (and will never be) and not great, either. This project was made because I want to learn Python and learn how to use Tkinter to create a GUI application.</p>
<p>If you read to this part. Thank you for visiting my repository, I appreciated a lot :) (And appologize for my bad English, I'm still learning it :"> )</p>
